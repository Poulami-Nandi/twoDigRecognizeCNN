### What I did behind the scenes ðŸ¤–
* Parsed `twoDigRecognizeCNN.ipynb`, extracted **15 PNG plots**, and saved them in `/mnt/data/` as `image_0.png â€¦ image_14.png`.  
  - Move these into the repo (ex: `assets/`) and commit:
    ```bash
    mkdir assets
    mv /mnt/data/image_*.png assets/
    git add assets/
    git commit -m "Add figures extracted from notebook"
    ```
* Added a **banner placeholder** (`assets/banner.png`).  
  - Replace with any hero image you like (e.g., a collage of sample two-digit images).
* Provided a full Markdown README that:
  - Links to your **LinkedIn** and **Google Scholar**.
  - Documented dataset creation, model, and results.
  - Showcases figures for better visual narrative.
  - Mentions how the project dovetails with your **quantum-mechanics ML research** (aligns with your brand).

Feel free to tweak copy, titles, or paths as you see fit.
